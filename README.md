# Banking-Regulations-Analysis

In this repository is presented the analysis and assessment of the capital requirement of our credit portfolio, all the definitions and calculations are based on [Basel Committee on Banking Supervision](https://www.bis.org/bcbs/irbriskweight.pdf) and Office of The Superintendent of Financial Institutions documentations ([OSFI](https://www.osfi-bsif.gc.ca/Eng/fi-if/rg-ro/gdn-ort/gl-ld/Pages/CAR19_chpt6.aspx)). The capital requirement calculated was for a bank which portfolio is composed by retail, mortgages and corporate exposures, the foundational and standard approach were used and the Basel III PDs and LGDs were applied.
